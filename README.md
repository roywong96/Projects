# [Project 1 : Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://github.com/roywong96/Titanic/blob/main/Titanic.ipynb)

- Two sets of data (i.e. Train and Test set) concatenated and preprocessed before modeling 
- Removed outliers, imputed any missing values and normalized the fare to obtain more accurate predictions.
- Engineered Features such as Family Size, Title (i.e 'Fam_Size', 'Title').
- Optimized and classified using Logistic Regression, K Neighbors Classifier, Support Vector Classifier, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Regressor.
- Voting Classifier is also used which takes all of the inputs and averages the results.
- Plot results using Bar graph of the Survivability of the passengers on the test data based on the trained.
- Accurately predicted 77.9% of the test set.

# [Project 2 : Mass Shootings in the United States](https://github.com/roywong96/Shooting_Analysis/blob/main/ShootingAnalysis.ipynb)

- Obtaining insight from the Data by MotherJones 
- This research is focused on indiscriminate rampages in public places resulting in four or more victims killed by the attacker.
- Seek to identify the cause of such Mass Killing in the USA.
- Several question included in the analysis
    - Are mass shootings on the rise?
    - What state/city had the most victims from mass shootings?
    - which states have the highest number of mass shootings?
    - Which year has the most mass shootings?
    - Which year did deadliest shootings in US occured and where?
    - Are most mass killers males or females?
    - Were the weapons used in shootings obtained legally?
    - What are the age of the youngest / oldest shooter?
    - What are the majority race of the shooters?
    - How many school shootings have been since 1982?
