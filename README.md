- Two sets of data (i.e. Train and Test set) concatenated and preprocessed before modeling 
- Removed outliers and imputed any missing values from the data.
- Optimized and classified using Logistic Regression, K Neighbors , SVC Linear, SVC RBF, Gaussian NB, Decision Tree, Random Forest
- Plot the Bar graph of the Survivability of the passengers on the test data based on the trained.
